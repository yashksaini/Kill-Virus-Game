# Kill Virus Game

Kill Virus Game is a simple and addictive web-based game. The player faces a 4x6 board where viruses come up on one column of each row from the bottom. The objective is to tap on the viruses to kill them before they reach the top. If a virus reaches the top, the player loses the game. However, if the player mistakenly taps on a tile other than the virus, the game also ends. The game's speed increases with time, and the score multiplies with the user's level.
